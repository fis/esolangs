	render(@plot,
		title: 'Duel lengths',
		desc: 'This plot shows duel lengths, in cycles, for all pairs of programs. The matrix shows, by default, the overall duel length, with the logarithmic color scale indicated by the bar on the left side. The theoretical maximum for the total is 4200000: 21 tape lengths, 2 polarities, 100000 cycles/duel. Separate results for the sieve and kettle polarities and different tape lengths are shown on the bottom bar graph, when hovering the mouse above a particular cell. Clicking a cell locks the selected pair; unlock by clicking again anywhere in the matrix. You can also use the controls below to show a particular tape/polarity slice in the matrix, or adjust the sort order.'
