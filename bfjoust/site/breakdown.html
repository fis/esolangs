<h3>Program result breakdown</h3>
<div id="breakdown">
	<p>
		This text will hopefully be replaced with a form that you can use to get the full results for a particular program.
		If that does not seem to be happening, check if scripts are allowed.

		Alternatively, check out the old-fashioned <a href="breakdown.txt">breakdown.txt</a>, though only applies to the latest program.
