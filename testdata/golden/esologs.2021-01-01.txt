00:00:20 <fizzie> BBC stream is a bit late too.
00:00:29 <fizzie> More than a minute, less than two.
00:00:30 <b_jonas> happy new year UK, Portugal, Iceland, and everyone in UTC+0
00:03:45 <fizzie> They're doing a drone show instead of the traditional fireworks.
00:04:08 <fizzie> It kinda leaked out early because they had to do an aviation traffic thingie to fly 300 drones in formation.
00:05:35 <b_jonas> wait what? isn't that a Marvel movie plot?
00:06:04 <b_jonas> with the bad buy controlling the drones
00:06:10 <b_jonas> and much more than 300
00:06:29 <fizzie> Mmaybe? But they've been doing these for a while now in reality too.
00:06:31 <b_jonas> how large drones?
00:06:40 <b_jonas> I mean how long battery time
00:06:53 <fizzie> I don't know, but this show takes just 10 minutes or so.
00:07:20 <b_jonas> 10 minutes. but with, I assume, brighter than usual led lighting.
00:07:29 <b_jonas> that shouldn't be too heavy
00:07:30 <fizzie> They're really just one of those RGB LED screens, except you can move the pixels around.
00:07:41 <b_jonas> right

05:06:51 <zzo38> Does analog television work with the common hobbyist level SDR sticks?
05:33:09 <esolangs> [[SELENE.]] M https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=79758&oldid=79755 * Tetrapyronia * (+285) (hopefully?) fixed specifications
05:36:37 <kmc> zzo38: no, I don't think so. standard NTSC has a 6 MHz bandwidth, PAL is about the same, and the RTL-SDR sticks max out around 2.4 MHz
05:36:41 <kmc> maybe you could use two
05:39:19 <kmc> the chip they use is actually a digital TV tuner chip (https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl2832u)
05:39:57 <kmc> but the raw I/Q output mode, which enables its myriad hobbyist uses as a cheap SDR receiver, doesn't support the full bandwidth of a TV signal
05:41:01 <zzo38> O, OK. Do you know if any SDR has a hardware switch to disable transmit in case you want to receive only, even if it is capable to transmit if you activate that switch?
05:41:06 <kmc> maybe due to USB limitations, I'm not sure
05:42:05 <kmc> in the original use case for the chip, the I/Q mode is used for audio broadcast reception (FM/DAB)
05:42:15 <kmc> zzo38: I don't know
05:42:27 <kmc> but many of them have separate ports for transmit and receive
05:42:34 <kmc> for example my bladeRF has
05:43:15 <kmc> so if you want to disable transmit, you could leave the TX port open or, ideally, attach an impedance-matched dummy load
05:43:34 <kmc> although, dummy loads aren't perfectly shielded and a very nearby radio might still be able to hear it
05:44:23 <kmc> I don't know if any SDR has a hardware switch to disable the TX frontend, although it seems like a good thing to have and should also be easy to do
05:45:01 <zzo38> OK
05:46:11 <kmc> the output power of the bladeRF is low to begin with (6 dBm, or about 4 mW)
05:46:36 <kmc> in many cases you would feed that into an external amplifier, and could effectively disable transmit by disconnecting or removing power from that
05:50:34 <kmc> then again, people manage to send signals around the globe on milliwatts
05:50:55 <kmc> with the right combination of good antenna, good conditions, and very slow data rate
05:55:53 <kmc> QRSS is a fairly esoteric idea
05:56:20 <kmc> sending/receiving morse code at a speed where a single dot takes 1-5 minutes
05:59:09 <kmc> generally not done by hand/ear!
05:59:18 <kmc> would require quite a bit of patience

10:08:58 <b_jonas> concert starting RSN
10:09:16 <b_jonas> TV is now broadcasting ads before it
10:10:10 <b_jonas> and right now I'm trying to make sure that I've got the FM radio set up correctly as a fallback in case there's a problem with the internet TV
10:10:30 <b_jonas> but they're just playing music so it's hard to tell that it's the right channel
10:11:38 <b_jonas> conveniently the internet TV will be delayed a bit, so if it fails, I can quickly switch to the radio and, in theory, not miss anything, though of course it's not nice to have music interrupted that way

10:29:27 <b_jonas> with four violins inside the rotating circular bow, each violin pressed into it when the corresponding string is supposed to play

10:39:43 <int-e> no
10:41:18 <b_jonas> I wish TVs didn't insist on having an always visible channel logo overlay. It made sense back in the analog TV days so you can easily tell which channel you tuned in, but these days with digital and internet TV it's rather redundant, they always put the channel name as meta-information anyway
10:42:12 <b_jonas> there's probably even a standard to send the logo as meta-info so the TV can display the list of channels in one of these silly icon mosic formats
10:42:35 <b_jonas> I've no idea, I almost never watch actual TV

19:17:58 <arseniiv> I want to get a constant income at last and somehow have more geographically near acquaintances who are interested or knowledgeable in the same as me, as I believe that’s the only effective way to have a job you like without hassle and luck
19:19:51 <arseniiv> as of now, I know nice and beautiful people but they are all this and that far away. That’s not a problem in itself but that’s a huge dent in a socialization I ended up with and I don’t particularly know yet how to fix it
19:21:20 <arseniiv> (of course I have relatives and their friends but they are all not mathematical or CS-y or techy almost at all. That’s a big problem as they lean on me for math- or computer-related things and I need to be better at them myself!)
